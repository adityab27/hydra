# Ingestion Endpoints and Protocols

## HTTP 

The HTTP ingest endpoint allows the streaming of discrete requests using the HTTP protocol.

### Request Metadata
All HTTP headers specified in the request are converted into HydraRequestMetadata objects and supplied as part of the request to all ingestors.


### Resource Format
| Path                      | Description                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ingest                 | Does not associate the request to any specific ingestor. <br> Events will be broadcast to all registered ingestors.     |
| ingest/[name] | Associates the request to a specific ingestor. <br> Events are published to that ingestor only. |


### Sample cURL Request
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ingest \
  -H "hydra-kafka-topic:test.TopicName" \
  -H "hydra-schema:TestSchema" \
  -H "hydra-validation-strategy:relaxed" \
  -d '{"name": "001c000001nlucqiaf", "handle": "152cba6e"}'
```

### Sample Response
```json
{"requestId":"FX3GTeML","status":{"code":200,"message":"OK"},"ingestors":{"kafka_ingestor":{"code":200,"message":"OK"}}}%
```

## Web Sockets

Hydra supports web sockets for event streaming with semantics that are very similar to the HTTP endpoint, with a few differences:

#### Request Metadata

These can be specified at connection time via HTTP headers beginning with `"hydra-***"` or after the socket has 
connected by issuing `SET` commands.

#### Request Payload
Once the metadata for the request has been set, clients can send payloads directly to the socket, without having to re-set these for every request. 

### Using the web socket connector

#### Enable the endpoint

Add this entry to your config:

```$xslt
hydra.ingest.websocket.enabled = true
```

The socket endpoint will be available at ```ws://[host]/ws-ingest```

### Resource Format

| Path                      | Description                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ws-ingest                 | Does not associate the request to any specific ingestor. <br> Events will be broadcast to all registered ingestors.     |
| ws-ingest/[name] | Associates the socket to a specific ingestor. <br> Events are published to that ingestor only. |


### Communication Protocol

> Web socket commands start with the ```-c``` switch.

#### `SET` command
Used to set request metadata.

**Syntax:**

To set request metadata:

```
-c SET hydra-kafka-topic = test.Topic
```

To list the current request metadata:

```
-c SET 
```

#### `HELP` command
Used to get a list of all available commands.

#### Ingestion

Sending any payload that does not begin with the command switch will initiate the ingestion protocol.

Ingestion payloads can include an optional request id, by prefixing the payload with a ```-i``` switch. For instance:

```-i 122 {"name":"test","value":"test"}```

### Sample Interaction
```bash
/connect ws://localhost:8080/ws-ingest/kafka_ingestor

-c set hydra-kafka-topic = test-topic
sent:	-c set hydra-kafka-topic = test-topic
response: {"status":200,"message":"OK[HYDRA-KAFKA_TOPIC=test-topic]"}

-c set hydra-ack = explicit
sent: -c set hydra-ack = explicit
response: {"status":200,"message":"OK[HYDRA-ACK=explicit]"}

{"name":"test","value":"test"}
sent: {"name":"test","value":"test"}

response: {"requestId":"GrnuqJBX","status":{"code":200,"message":"OK"},"ingestors":{"kafka_ingestor":{"code":200,"message":"OK"}}}
```
