# Hydra
Hydra is a fast real-time streaming and data replication platform that "unbundles" the receiving, transforming, 
and production of data streams.

It does so by abstracting these phases independently from each other while providing a unifying API across them.

## Why Replication?

## Streaming Processing Phases

### Receive

### Transform

### Produce

## Online Documentation
We highly recommend checking out the project documentation [here](www.pluralsight.com.)  There you can find the latest documentation, including examples, API endppoints, and a lot more.

This README file only contains basic definitions and set up instructions.

## Building Hydra
Hydra is built using [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). To build Hydra, run:

```
sbt clean compile
```
